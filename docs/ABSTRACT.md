# ABSTRACT

This capstone project presents Sign Wave, a mobile application designed to bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing individuals through real-time sign language translation. The application addresses a significant social challenge: the communication barriers faced by approximately 70 million deaf people worldwide in their daily interactions with the hearing population.

Sign Wave leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures and convert them into text and speech. Simultaneously, it provides speech-to-text capabilities, enabling two-way communication. The application features an intuitive user interface, video call integration with translation overlay, and offline functionality for essential phrases.

The development process followed an agile methodology, incorporating extensive user research with members of the deaf community to ensure the application meets their actual needs. The technical implementation utilizes Flutter for cross-platform compatibility, TensorFlow Lite for on-device machine learning inference, Firebase for backend services, and ZegoCloud for real-time video communication.

User testing with both deaf and hearing participants demonstrated significant improvements in communication efficiency and satisfaction compared to traditional methods. The application achieved a sign recognition accuracy of 85% for common phrases and words in controlled environments, with performance varying based on lighting conditions and gesture clarity.

Sign Wave contributes to social inclusion by facilitating easier communication between deaf and hearing individuals in educational, workplace, healthcare, and social settings. Future development will focus on expanding the sign language vocabulary, improving recognition accuracy in varied environments, and adding support for additional sign languages beyond ASL.
