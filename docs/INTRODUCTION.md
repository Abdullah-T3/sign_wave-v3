# CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 OVERVIEW

Sign Wave is a mobile application designed to bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing individuals through real-time sign language translation. The application leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to recognize sign language gestures and convert them into text and speech, while also providing speech-to-text capabilities for two-way communication.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals face significant communication barriers in daily interactions with hearing people who don't understand sign language. Traditional methods of communication such as writing notes or using human interpreters are often impractical, time-consuming, or unavailable. This communication gap affects educational opportunities, healthcare access, employment prospects, and social inclusion for the deaf community.

## 1.3 The Applied Approach

Sign Wave adopts a multi-modal approach to address the communication challenge:

1. **Sign Language Recognition**: Using computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time
2. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Translating recognized signs into audible speech for hearing individuals
3. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Converting spoken language into text for deaf users
4. **Video Call Integration**: Enabling remote communication with built-in translation capabilities
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Designing an intuitive experience accessible to all users regardless of hearing ability

## 1.4 Capstone Project Objective

The primary objective of this capstone project is to develop a functional, user-friendly mobile application that facilitates seamless communication between deaf and hearing individuals through real-time sign language translation and speech conversion technologies.

Specific objectives include:

- Implementing accurate sign language recognition for common phrases and words
- Creating a responsive and accessible user interface
- Integrating video calling functionality with translation overlay
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)
- Conducting thorough user testing with members of the deaf community

## 1.8 Significance of Proposed Capstone Project

The Sign Wave application has significant potential impact in several areas:

1. **Social Inclusion**: Facilitating easier communication between deaf and hearing individuals promotes greater social inclusion and reduces isolation.

2. **Educational Access**: Enabling deaf students to better communicate with hearing teachers and peers can improve educational outcomes.

3. **Employment Opportunities**: Reducing communication barriers in the workplace can open more employment opportunities for deaf individuals.

4. **Healthcare Access**: Improving communication in healthcare settings can lead to better health outcomes for deaf patients.

5. **Technological Innovation**: Advancing the application of machine learning and computer vision technologies in assistive communication tools.

6. **Awareness and Understanding**: Increasing awareness about sign language and deaf culture among the hearing population.

## 1.9 Capstone Project Organization

The project team is organized into the following roles and responsibilities:

1. **Project Manager**: Oversees the entire project, ensures timelines are met, and coordinates between different team members

2. **UI/UX Designer**: Responsible for creating intuitive and accessible user interfaces

3. **Frontend Developer**: Implements the user interface using Flutter framework

4. **Backend Developer**: Handles server-side logic, database management, and API integration
